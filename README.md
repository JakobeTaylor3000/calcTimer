# calcTimer
Program to time how long it takes to calculate

## Results
Giving the program that has been coded to test which math function calculate the fastest. As I was going through each function, each code for each function were having errors because they were having undeclared variables and errors explaining that they can't convert double to float and double to int. I've seek help from the professor, the lecture videos, and the web. They've given me an idea of the program actually works. I've fix the program errors and gotten results in the end.Addition and addition by float were tied for calculation.
